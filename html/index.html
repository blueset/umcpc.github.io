        What we do

      <p class="ind">
        This club aims to organise the University of Melbourne's competitive programming endeavours in order to create
        results that an institution of this calibre deserves. Simultaneously it is an attempt to create a tight-knit 
        community of science-loving students who can experience together what college life has to offer.
      </p>
      <p class="ind">
        The programming competitions that this club participates in are those that involve being given a set of
        difficult questions which must be solved through the submission of computer code. The problems vary in topic
        wildly, but the answer usually involves the use of mathematics or algorithms and is a program written in a 
        language such as C++ or Java. While beginner problem sets may seem simple enough, prepare to spend days 
        toiling away at a difficult question.
      </p>
      <p class="ind">
        Above all other competitions, the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) will be the focus of
        this club's activities. The ICPC has three rounds, a divisional, regional and world championship. Divisionals 
        have an open entry policy, but only the top teams will progress to regionals. Regionals is hosted across
        Australia and New Zealand, and luckily that landed us (Team O L D B O Y S) a trip to Auckland in 2015. Those 
        who work hard enough can acquire a ticket overseas if they conquer the regional finals and enter the world
        championship. The typical ICPC round will require approximately twelve questions to be answered within five 
        hours by teams of three. Don't expect to answer anywhere near twelve questions though. More information will
        be provided at meetings, and if you're unable to attend just message an admin over the facebook group or email
        us (details in the Contact Us just down the page).
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is welcome to join. All you need is an insatiable thirst for knowledge!

        The conception of this club was what seemed like an afterthought Jonathan mumbled during the quiet flight 
        over the Tasman Sea. We had just been overwhelmed at the regional ICPC competition in Auckland, our string of
        flukes slowly chewed through by five suffocating hours of failure. After welcoming the suggestion however, it 
        became clear that it was far more than just a passing thought of his, my teammate was determined to establish
        a competitive programming club in our university. The first step was to enlist the aid of his comrades in 
        coding. 
      </p>
      <p class="ind">
        Having shared in the lows of defeat and the highs of travel together we felt closer to each other than ever
        before. The sneaker-tearing climb across a dormant volcano, our fearful venture into a shady youth hostel (which
        was a wonderful place come sunrise), the oversized drinks at Wendy's, my futile attempts to find a fish and chips 
        store, carefully avoiding cow pies in order to eat canned food at the summit of a remote country campsite while
        witnessing a breathtaking sunset, and of course sharing an intimately small tent for the night. All our
        experiences will forever be some of my dearest memories. During the elation brought by our companionship we
        eagerly accepted the proposition, dreaming also of success in the following years championship. Bearing an
        enormous ego, I joined with the condition of trading presidential status for team-captaincy, Jonathan preferring
        the latter. After landing however, the difficulties that lay ahead became clear and Daniel decided to part ways 
        with the team. So here we are, naturally behind schedule, hoping that this story has a happy ending.

        Andy Lok gave a presention on the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which can solve the shortest path problem with negative edges, and
        also detect negative cycles. We looked at two example questions.

        This is a fairly straight foward application of the negative cycle detection in Bellman-Ford.

        This graph looks like you could use Bellman-Ford, and you could. However, you would never finish within the timelimit. We may
        look into algorithms that can solve this faster.

        Hint: This is a travelling salesman problem with 11 nodes. It's just barely possible to brute force
        with good code. If there were up to 16ish nodes, you'd need to use a variation of knapsack. The key is using
        bitmasks to represent different states of the graph.

        Jonathan talked about dynamic programming using examples such as generating fibonacci numbers and the 'Knapsack'
        problem. Dynamic programming is a paradigm that involves memorising certain answers which need to be calculated
        more than once. Google it to find out more.

        The first ever training session! Students began to form teams and work on UVA problems together. The four

        In this meeting we discussed four problems. First everyone attempted to sort them by difficulty, after which
        they tried to find a solution on paper.
